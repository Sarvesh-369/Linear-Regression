# Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Linear Regression model using a sample train and test dataset. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## About Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors). It assumes that the relationship between the variables is approximately linear.

## Implementation Details

This project provides a basic implementation of Linear Regression using Python, Numpy and Pandas library. The key components of this implementation include:

- [Linear_Regression.ipynb](Linear_Regression.ipynb): A Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the steps for training and evaluating a Linear Regression model on the sample train and test datasets.
- [train_processed_splitted.csv](train_processed_splitted.csv): Sample training data containing feature(s) and target variable.
- [test_processed_splitted.csv](test_processed_splitted.csv): Sample test data used for making predictions with the trained model.
